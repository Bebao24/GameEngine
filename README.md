# Game engine
## General
A 2D game engine written in C++. It is still in early development. <br>
It uses OpenGL for rendering and GLFW for creating window.

## Status
For now, you probably can't use this game engine since there's no documentations. <br>

### Platform (Operating systems)
Currently, this game engine is only supporting linux and MacOS. It is developed on Linux mainly.
I have tested this on MacOS, after some patches, I can comfirm that it works perfectly.
On Windows, you cannot compile this since you will need GLFW installed on your system.

## Plans
In the future, I would try to add a simple documentations when this game engine is more complete and usable. <br>
Unfortunately, I don't have any plans to support 3D rendering yet.
